## This file contains my personal error logs.

Being human, it is okay to make mistakes. They are our teachers and we should try to learn from each mistakes.
It's not only during GRE, in our everyday life as well.

## The following are my few error logs: 

- Vocabulary has saturated my mind, I am not being able to grasp new words and slowly forgetting old words.
  Solution:
  -> Needs frequent revision till I become comfortable.
  -> Need to make mnemonics for difficult words.
  -> Brings obscure words to use.
